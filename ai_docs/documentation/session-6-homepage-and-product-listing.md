# Session 6: Homepage and Product Listing Implementation

## Date: 2025-01-15 (Continued from Session 5)

## Summary
Completed Day 6 tasks including homepage with featured products and both client-side and server-side product listing pages. Fixed database migration issues, re-implemented category APIs, and created comprehensive UI components.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Database Migration Resolution
- **Issue**: Drizzle Kit was stuck with interactive prompts about slug column
- **Solution**: Used `npx drizzle-kit push` to directly apply schema to empty database
- **Result**: All tables created successfully with enhanced schema

### 2. Database Seeding Fixed
- **Issue**: `crypto` was not defined in seed script
- **Fix**: Changed to `import { randomUUID } from 'crypto';`
- **Result**: Successfully seeded 7 categories and 12 products

### 3. Category API Re-implementation
After fixing the database, re-implemented all category routes:
- `/api/categories/route.ts` - List and create categories
- `/api/categories/[id]/route.ts` - Single category CRUD
- `/api/categories/tree/route.ts` - Hierarchical tree with product counts

### 4. Homepage Implementation (`/src/app/page.tsx`)

#### Features Implemented:
- **Hero Section**:
  - Gradient background (blue-50 to white)
  - Grand Opening Sale badge with Sparkles icon
  - Dual CTAs: "Shop Now" and "Browse Categories"
  - Responsive text sizing
  - Decorative background pattern

- **Featured Products Section**:
  - Server-side data fetching from `/api/products/featured`
  - Suspense boundary with loading skeletons
  - 8-product grid (responsive 1/2/4 columns)
  - Product cards with:
    - Image display with hover zoom effect
    - Sale badges with discount percentage
    - Low stock warnings ("Only X left")
    - Out of stock indicators
    - Star ratings with review count
    - Brand and category information
    - Sale price with strikethrough original
    - Add to Cart button (disabled when out of stock)

- **Features Section**:
  - 3-column grid showcasing:
    - Free Shipping (Truck icon)
    - Secure Shopping (Shield icon)
    - Easy Returns (CreditCard icon)

- **Newsletter CTA**:
  - Gradient card (blue-600 to blue-700)
  - Email input with subscribe button
  - Responsive layout

### 5. Product Listing Pages

#### A. Client-Side Implementation (`/src/app/products/page.tsx`)
Created a fully-featured client-side product listing with:

**Filtering System**:
- Category selection with product counts
- Price range slider (0-$1000)
- Brand checkboxes (dynamically populated)
- In-stock only toggle
- Search bar with icon

**Sorting Options**:
- Newest/Oldest first
- Price: Low to High / High to Low
- Name: A-Z / Z-A
- Highest Rated

**User Experience**:
- Active filters displayed as removable badges
- Mobile-responsive with Sheet component for filters
- Loading skeletons during data fetch
- Empty state with clear messaging
- Pagination with page numbers

**Technical Implementation**:
- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- URL search params for filter state
- API integration with `/api/products`
- Responsive grid (1/2/3 columns)

#### B. Server-Side Implementation (`/src/app/(shop)/products/page.tsx`)
Created a server-rendered product listing with:

**Architecture**:
- Server Component with async data fetching
- Direct Drizzle ORM database queries
- No client-side JavaScript required for basic functionality
- SEO-friendly with server-side rendering

**Features**:
- URL parameter-based filtering:
  - `?search=` - Search products
  - `?category=` - Filter by category ID
  - `?sort=` - Sort options
  - `?minPrice=` & `?maxPrice=` - Price range
  - `?page=` - Pagination
- Product grid with full details
- Server-rendered pagination with Previous/Next
- Active filter badges
- Empty state handling

**Performance Benefits**:
- Smaller client bundle
- Better SEO
- Faster initial page load
- Works without JavaScript

### 6. TypeScript Compilation
- Verified zero errors with `npx tsc --noEmit`
- All components fully type-safe
- Proper Next.js 15 async params handling

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Dual Product Listing Approach
Created both client-side and server-side implementations to demonstrate:
- **Client-side**: Rich interactivity, real-time filtering
- **Server-side**: Better SEO, performance, accessibility

### 2. Component Architecture
- Used shadcn/ui components throughout (Card, Badge, Button, Skeleton)
- Implemented Suspense boundaries for better UX
- Created reusable ProductCard component

### 3. Data Fetching Strategy
- Homepage: Server-side fetching with fetch API
- Client listing: Client-side with useEffect
- Server listing: Direct Drizzle queries

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Complete homepage replacement
- `/src/app/products/page.tsx` - Client-side product listing
- `/src/app/(shop)/products/page.tsx` - Server-side product listing

### Modified
- `/ai_docs/technical/implementation-todo-plan.md` - Updated progress to 65%

## Code Highlights

### Homepage Featured Products Fetching
```typescript
async function getFeaturedProducts() {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(
      `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'}/api/products/featured`,
      { cache: 'no-store' }
    );
    
    if (!res.ok) {
      console.error('Failed to fetch featured products');
      return [];
    }
    
    const data = await res.json();
    return data.products || [];
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching featured products:', error);
    return [];
  }
}
```

### Product Card Component
```typescript
function ProductCard({ product }: { product: any }) {
  const discountPercentage = product.salePrice 
    ? Math.round(((parseFloat(product.price) - parseFloat(product.salePrice)) / parseFloat(product.price)) * 100)
    : 0;

  return (
    <Card className="group hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow duration-300">
      {/* Full implementation with badges, pricing, ratings */}
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Server Component with Drizzle
```typescript
export default async function ProductsPage({
  searchParams,
}: {
  searchParams: { search?: string; category?: string; /* etc */ };
}) {
  // Direct database query
  const products = await db
    .select({/* fields */})
    .from(productsTable)
    .leftJoin(categories, eq(productsTable.categoryId, categories.id))
    .where(conditions)
    .orderBy(orderBy)
    .limit(limit)
    .offset(offset);

  // Server-rendered component
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6">
      {/* Product cards */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Next Steps

Based on the implementation plan, the next tasks are:
1. Create product detail pages (`/products/[slug]`)
2. Add category navigation UI
3. Implement search UI components
4. Create filter sidebar with advanced options

## Lessons Learned

1. **Database Migrations**: When Drizzle Kit prompts for interactive input, using `push` instead of `migrate` can be more appropriate for development
2. **Server vs Client Components**: Having both implementations showcases the trade-offs and benefits of each approach
3. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types throughout the application prevent runtime errors
4. **Component Reusability**: Creating reusable components like ProductCard saves development time

## Notes

- Node.js version compatibility remains important for local development
- The dual implementation approach (client + server) provides flexibility for different use cases
- All implementations follow Next.js 15 best practices and conventions
- The project maintains consistent styling with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
