# Go-To-Market Manifesto: TechStore Custom E-commerce Development

## 1. ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

We focus on **small to medium business owners** who operate profitable product-based businesses, typically with:

- **Annual revenue**: $200K - $2M range
- **Team size**: 2-15 employees, usually family-owned or bootstrapped businesses
- **Industry**: Retail, consumer goods, artisan products, specialty equipment, or niche products
- **Current setup**: Already selling online via Shopify, WooCommerce, or SquareSpace but hitting platform limitations
- **Business stage**: Established businesses (2+ years) that have proven product-market fit and steady customer base
- **Geographic focus**: US-based businesses with established operations who can appreciate the long-term ROI of custom development

## 2. Current Workflow / Jobs to be Done and Pain Points

These business owners currently spend **15-25 hours per week** managing their e-commerce operations, dealing with platform limitations that cost them money and opportunities:

**Major pain points:**

- Paying **$300-$1,200+ monthly** in platform fees plus 2.4-2.9% transaction fees (costing $12K-$50K annually)
- **Cannot customize** checkout flows, product pages, or customer experience to match their brand
- **Limited integration** capabilities with their inventory, accounting, or CRM systems
- **Restricted by platform rules** on pricing, promotions, and customer communications
- **No ownership** of customer data and limited analytics capabilities
- **Generic look and feel** that doesn't differentiate them from competitors

**Value Proposition:**
"TechStore Development helps established e-commerce business owners achieve complete platform independence and eliminate ongoing platform fees through custom-built e-commerce solutions that they fully own and control."

## 3. Price

**Cost-benefit analysis:**

- Average client spending $1,000-$3,000/month on platform + transaction fees ($12K-$36K annually)
